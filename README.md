What is nickoin?
----------------

nickoin is a joke coin made by Nick Simmonds within about a day to demonstrate that it
takes no real depth of knowledge anymore to launch a coin, just a whim and an afternoon.
It was largely done with the tutorial [here](https://www.hackster.io/pjdecarlo/how-to-make-a-cryptocurrency-using-litecoin-v0-15-source-fb5e82#toc-10--deploy-a-minimum-of-2-nodes-12_).

If you try to do it yourself, the tutorial is a little out of date but gets you 95% of
the way there. This is a fork of Litecoin and is in progress, some places might reference
Litecoin instead of Nickoin.
