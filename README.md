# Nickoin

A blockchain implementation exploring cryptocurrency architecture and consensus mechanisms.

## What is this?

An experimental altcoin built to understand blockchain fundamentals hands-on. Forked from Litecoin, this project explores:
- Proof-of-work consensus implementation
- P2P network architecture for distributed ledgers  
- Cryptocurrency wallet/transaction mechanics
- Build toolchains for compiled blockchain clients

Built following [this tutorial](link) as a structured learning exercise, then extended with custom modifications.

## Why build this?

The best way to understand distributed consensus systems is to build one. This project demystifies blockchain beyond the hype: understanding the actual engineering constraints, security models, and architectural tradeoffs. **This is not a coin meant for distribution**. Please do not mine Nickoins; as a safeguard I've mined a bunch myself and will absolutely dump them and ruin the market if you try to make money off this.

## Status

Experimental/educational. Some references to Litecoin remain from the original fork.
